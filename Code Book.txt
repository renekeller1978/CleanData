The two datasets in this exercise are:
CombinedDS.txt 
AverageDS.txt

Both datasets contain the same number of Features (66 in total):

Features:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation


Additional variables are:
MeasurementsText: measurement of the movement in Text form (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
Subject: subject ID
	
For CombinedDS.txt the values for the features represent the values at the different observation points, for AverageDS, the values represent the mean ffor each acttivity and Subject.
